1. Create a function that performs basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) between two numbers, according to the user's choice. The function's input will be the two operands and the character used for the operation.

    To complete the task, the function ``operations`` was used. It has *three arguments* -the operation and the two numbers- and through a *match-case statement* and *four lambda functions*, performs the desired operation on the two numbers, returning the result.
